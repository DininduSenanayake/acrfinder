## I. Installation / Dependencies

Clone/download the repository. Some dependencies are included and can be found in the <span style='color:tomato'>dependencies/</span> directory. Program expects these versions and using other versions can result in unexpected behavior.

`CRISPRCasFinder` - Already in <span style='color:tomato'>dependencies/</span> directory. To use `CRISPRCasFinder` on your machine make sure you run its install script. The manual can be found <a href='https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/Home/Download'>here</a>. Running the install script will setup paths for all the dependencies of `CRISPRCasFinder`.

It is a common problem to forget to install `CRISPRCasFinder`, so ensure that `CRISPRCasFinder` runs properly before executing <span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>acr_aca_cri_runner.py</span> to avoid errors.

`blastn` - <span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>acr_aca_cri_runner.py</span> will call/use `blastn` to search a genome. Install `blastn` from <a href='https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download'>NCBI</a>.

`psiblast+` - Used with CDD's to find Acr/Aca proteins. Install at <a href='https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download'>NCBI</a>.

`python3` - For all scripts with .py extension. Use any version at or above 3.4.

`PyGornism` - Already in <span style='color:tomato'>dependencies/</span> directory. Used to parse organism files and generate organism files in certain formats.

<div id='about' />

## II. About

### AcrFinder is a tool used to identify Anti-CRISPR proteins (Acr) using sequence alignment and guilt-by-association.

This README file contains information about only the python scripts found in the immediate directory. These are the scripts that make up the program that identifies Acr/Aca regions.

To find out how to use other dependencies look at online sources:

`CRISPRCasFinder` - https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/CrisprCasFinder/Index

*`CRISPRCasFinder` is used to identify CRISPR Cas systems. This will then be used to <a href='#classification'>classify</a> Acr/Aca regions. If no CRISPR Cas systems are found within a NCID then only homology based method will be implemented for Acr search.

<div id='using_acrfinder' />

### **III. <span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>Using AcrFinder</span>**

#### Input

AcrFinder needs **.fna**, **.gff** and **.faa** as input. Only **.fna** file as input is also acceptable, then the **.gff** and **.faa** file will be generated by <a href='https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal'>Prodigal</a>.

#### Output 

#### Classification

There are three levels of classification in output:

| Classification       | Meaning     |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Low Confidence       | There were no CRISPR Cas systems found that self targeted the organism.                   |
| Medium Confidence    | There were self targeting CRISPR Cas systems. However, the region of self targeting was not near the Acr/Aca locus. "Near" means within 5,000 BP                                                                                                       |
| High Confidence      | There were self targeting spacers. There was also a region of self targeting nearby.  |

<!-- 
Uses the following filters to identify Acr/Aca proteins:

1) Acr/Aca proteins must exist on the same strand in order to be grouped together (group = locus).
2) Acr/Aca proteins must be a length <= **m** (aa) {default = 150}.
3) Proteins must be adjacent (next to each other).
4) Adjacent proteins must be seperated by a certain threshold, distance <= **d** (bp) {default = 250}.
5) There must be at least **r** total proteins for a group to be considred an Acr/Aca locus {default = 2}.
6) There must be at least one Aca* (protein with an HTH domain) in the locus.

*Note: Aca proteins are identified using HTH HMM's found in <span style='color:tomato'>dependencies/hth_hmm</span> -->

<!-- Using the above filters will result in candidate Acr/Aca regions and these candidates can be further filtered. This is done by using PSSM's and looking up pathogenicity databases. The databases used are IslandViewer and PHASTER. The files used can be found in <span style='color:tomato'>dependencies/all_gis_islandviewer_iv4.txt</span>  and <span style='color:tomato'>dependencies/z_DNA_fragment_DB.header</span> respectfully.

The PSSM's used were chosen because they imply Anti-CRISPR functionality. They can be found in <span style='color:tomato'>dependencies/cdds</span>.

By default the pathogenicity databases aren't used to filter the candidate Acr/Aca regions. However, CDD's are used by default.

If a pathogenicy database is specified for use, the default method used to check is "lax". This method will include candidate Acr/Aca regions in the final result set if at least one protein in the Acr/Aca locus is found within a pathogenic region. "strict" will include candidate Acr/Aca regions in the final result set if all proteins are found within a pathogenic region.

Both the selected results from the pathogenicity databases and the CDD's are used. -->

<!-- **For example**

| Locus # | Protein | Within Pathogenic region?   | CDD hit?   |
| -----  | ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| 1     | WP00001      | NO | NO |
| 1     | WP00002      | NO | NO |
| 1     | WP00003      | NO | NO |
| 2     | WP00010      | YES | NO |
| 2     | WP00011      | NO | NO |
| 3     | WP00021      | YES | NO |
| 3     | WP00022      | YES | NO |
| 3     | WP00022      | YES | NO |
| 4     | WP00031      | NO | YES |
| 4     | WP00032      | NO | YES |
| 4     | WP00033      | NO | YES |

If using no pathogenicity databases: Locus 4 alone is chosen

If using pathogenic databases (lax): locus 2,3 and 4 are chosen

If using pathogenic databases (strict): locus 3 and 4 are chosen -->

### **IV. <span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>Docker Support</span>**

To help users to configure the environment to use the software easily, we provide the _.Dockerfile_ can be used using the command:

```bash
cd path/to/repo
docker build -t [tag name] .
```

or you can pull the image from docker hub using the command:

```bash
docker pull [OPTIONS] haidyi/AcrFinder:latest
```

<!-- Runs `CRISPRCasFinder`.

After execution is complete the file <span style='color:tomato'>result.json</span> is parsed. The CRISPR spacers with evidence level greater than or equal to the evidence level passed as an arguemnt (see below) are selected. An fna file is created of just these spacers.

***Note: If no spacers (of any confidence level) are found then execution terminates for this script and any calling scripts**

A new fna file is created from the provided organism fna file. This fna file will have all spacers 'blanked out' with the letter N <+- 500> surounding BP. These 'blanking out' will ensure that any blast queries will not target the spacers themselves. A useless result. This newly created file is called <span style='color:tomato'>masked.fna</span>.

A blast database is created using <span style='color:tomato'>masked.fna</span>.

blastn is used with the new organism fna file as the query and uses the database created from the spacers. Only results with identity >= 95% are kept. -->

**<span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>command_options.py</span>** - defines options users can use to customize the scripts functionality

**<span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>fastafy_select_spacers.py</span>** - parses <span style='color:tomato'>result.json</span> produced by `CRISPRCasFinder`.

**<span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>mask_fna_with_spacers.py</span>** - uses the generated spacer file to mask or "blank out" CRISPR spacers to create a new FNA file that doesn't have references of the spacers. This is used to avoid self targeting the spacers with blastn. A region of +- 500 BP sorounding each spacer is also masked. The new FNA file is named <span style='color:tomato'>masked.fna</span> -->

### **VI. FAQ**

**Q) I ran <span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>acr_aca_cri_runner.py</span> and I got errors that pertain to CRISPR/Cas. Whats the issue?**

A) Make sure `CRIPSRCasFinder` is installed properly. `CRIPSRCasFinder` has many dependencies of its own and will only work if they are all installed correctly. A good indicator of a correctly installed `CRIPSRCasFinder` is the following terminal output:

```bash
################################################################
# --> Welcome to dependencies/CRISPRCasFinder/CRISPRCasFinder.pl (version 4.2.17)
################################################################


vmatch2 is...............OK
mkvtree2 is...............OK
vsubseqselect2 is...............OK
fuzznuc (from emboss) is...............OK
needle (from emboss) is...............OK
```

<!-- **Q) `CRIPSRCasFinder` is running correctly and I get the following message, "No CRISPRCas systems found. Terminating...". Why is that?**

A) There were no CRISPR Cas systems found within the same NCID/sequence. The program will not try to find Acr/Aca proteins in an organism that has no CRISPR Cas systems in the same NCID/sequence.

You can run <span style='color:RebeccaPurple'>acr_aca_finder.py</span> to just execute the Acr/Aca identification with no restrictions due to CRISPR Cas systems. -->
